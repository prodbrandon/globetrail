- **Modern Web UI:** Built with Next.js and TypeScript for a responsive and interactive experience.
- **Extensible Backend:** Python-powered backend for integrating APIs and advanced AI tasks.

 ## Inspiration

As avid travelers and technologists, we noticed how overwhelming trip planning can be. From sifting through endless blogs to piecing together accommodation, transport, and activities, the process is both time-consuming and fragmented. Most travel platforms offer generic recommendations, missing the context of *who* you are and *how* you like to travel. We wanted to change that by building an AI-powered agent that acts as your personal travel assistant—making itinerary planning as seamless and personalized as possible.


## How we built it

We used a modern, scalable stack:
- **Frontend:** Next.js and React for a dynamic, responsive UI. TypeScript for type safety.
- **Backend:** Python for agentic AI logic via Gemini, itinerary generation, and third-party API integrations.
- **AI and APIs:** Integrates with travel data APIs and leverages LLMs for personalized suggestions.


### What's next for Globetrail

- Add real-time collaboration for group trip planning.
- Integrate booking capabilities directly into the platform.
- Expand the agent’s knowledge with user feedback and preferences over time.
- Launch a mobile companion app for on-the-go trip management.
